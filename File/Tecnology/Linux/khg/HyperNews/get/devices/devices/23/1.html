I have the Iwill motherboard with TX chipset (and a K6, ultrawide SCSI, and SDRAM). <p>

When I tried to boot or install RedHat 4.2, the 
system would dump a bunch of error messages about 
"unknown PCI device" then it would reboot. So, I 
built the 2.1.43 kernel with modules and the new 
tools 'n libs. Now the system doesn't print the 
error messages so I guess I have the TX chipset in 
the kernel, but it <b>still reboots</b> in the same place.
Best I can tell, it's <b>during the "Calibrating delay 
loop.." phase</b>. I've stripped the system down to a 
kernel on a floppy and it still reboots early in
the boot. This same .43 kernel boots a Cyrix 166 
VX chipset motherboard just fine. <p>

Two other notes: (1) this K6-TX system <b>boots Win95 
just fine</b>. The PnP stuff barks about the PCI-ISA 
bridge, but floppies were included so I presume that 
those drivers are in there.<br>
(2) I have <b>successfully booted linux on this system 
twice</b>. The very first time I was running setup and 
got as far as the fdisk, then I decided to start 
over and it would not come up again after that. Then 
a week later (after many other failed attempts) I 
tried booting an already configured linux from a 
SCSI drive, it booted (400 BogoMIPs!) and I got 
to poke around a bit. Then, I shut down so I could 
change the drive order, and it would not come up 
again and it hasn't since. <p>

Any help would be much appreciated, though I may
just return the sucker. <p>
