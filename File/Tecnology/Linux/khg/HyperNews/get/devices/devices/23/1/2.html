folks keep emailing me to see if i have any more
ideas about this so i guess there's still interest.
i'm back just to recap (i don't mind answering the
emails, but why not knock'em all off at once :)
<P>

i had two problems with my TX chipset iwill motherboard
and RedHat linux:
<P>

1. "unknown PCI device" errors
<P>

2. reboot very early, very quickly, right after 
those errors so you couldn't really read them.
<P>

the unknown PCI device errors were fixed by the 2.1.43
kernel, but it was a real pain in the neck to build
because of all of the tools that needed updating also.
<P>

however, the reboot problem continued. i changed clockspeeds, 
cpus (intel, amd, cyrix) i swapped memory (sdram, edo) and
i even tried caldera's linux and redhat 3 instead of 4.
i also swapped for another iwill motherboard, same model,
then i swapped for an abit motherboard, no tx chipset.
i also tried win95 and NT. no question, the problem was 
with this model of the iwill motherboard running linux. OK?
<P>

after watching a zillion reboots, i became convinced that
the problem was in the bogomips thingy. if you are seeing
different behavior, we may not be talking about the same
problem.
<P>

now, that very same broken system, on 3 random occasions, 
booted linux just fine: everything worked those three times.
<P>

so, my conclusion is that there is one problem with the board,
and it's some kind of a timing thing that is uncovered by
the bogomips thingy, and it's probably a one line code fix --
i'm thinking, if you could just get by that one thing, it 
would be smooth sailing. hmmm... so that gives me an idea:
could that calibration routine easily be replaced by a
reasonable approximation of the timing that it's trying to
figure out? not a long term solution, but just to test the
theory that it's just one little bug... i wish i had tried
that then but i didn't think of it.
<P>

what i thought of was launching the boot into a debugger,
something i don't know how to do and figured wasn't worth
learning for this particular problem since there are 100's
of other motherboards that work just fine. i returned mine :)
good luck to anybody who doesn't :( have that option
<P>
