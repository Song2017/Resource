<PRE>Hello out there,
 I have a demo unit of the M-system Disk on chip. It is a 
4-72 Meg Flash file system, EEprom NV-Ram. The kit came 
with an eval card that you just stick into a 16-bit ISA port. 
 The way the thing works (as far as I can tell)- you set 
the host card on a boot address in ram (like D0000) and when 
the system boots up it loads a hardware driver that translates 
the disk-on-chip as a standard hard drive. DOS is easily
fooled, and the system will bootup and see the disk-on-chip
as a standard Hard drive. It works great in DOS - but
linux will not recognize the device. Acording to the people 
at M-system they might work on a linux driver soon (god only
knows when that might happen). They did tell me that the eval 
card that comes with the chip is much like a SCSI host 
adapter. And there documentation states that the chip should 
work with any 32-pin DIP JEDEC EEPROM compliant port.
 If anyone has a clue on where to beggin in attempting to get 
this to work in linux I'd be very intrested. 
 I have tried to get the device to work in DOSEMU with no luck 
as well.</PRE>
