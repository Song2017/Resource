At the moment I have two devices, one is the ISA card
which contains 4MB of flash memory. The other is an 8MB
"chip" which plugs into a SBC that I hope to get linux
running on - by fair means or foul.
<P>

So far as I can see, the devices work as a segemnt of shared
memory. You plug a command into an address (I don't have
any information about what address) and possibly data you
want to write, then set an EXECUTE flag and the device
will perform the command.
In this respect it is a lot like a RAM filesystem, or as
the man suggested a SCSI device with a dual port i/o buffer.
<P>

There seem to be some added difficilties with Flash, that
writes are slow, and the device "wears out" after a while.
<P>

My idea at the moment (which has worked o.k. for the ISA
card flash memeory) is to boot into DOS, then use loadlin
to boot a kernel with root=nfs.
I have got this to work (obviously, you need another linux
box - with RARP enabled - to supply the NFS filesystem)
to the point where it boots, you can log in etc. So far
X windows isn't confiured, stay tuned....

<P>
