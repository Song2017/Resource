<p>There are two basic steps to getting new pieces into
the Linux kernel.  The first is to have other people test
them; that should include feedback from other kernel
developers on the linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu mailing
list.

<p>After the patches have been tested, the second step
is to send them to Linus
for inclusion.  You may have to do this several times;
his email often exceeds his capability to absorb it, so
he assumes that important email will get retransmitted.
Also, he may ask you to change things; if you aren't
getting a response from him it may be because he is not
satisfied with the patch in some way; feel free to ask
him why if you've sent the
patch a few times and it hasn't gone in yet.
