On booting up my system I have made sure (using setup) that IRQ's 3,4,7,9,10,11,14,15 are all free. I have a data acquistion PCI card which has been inserted.
<P>

When I boot linux and look at /proc/pci it tells me that my network card, video card and my d.a. board have all been assigned to IRQ10 ! The IRQs 3,4,7,11,14,15 are still free! (SCSI controller has IRQ9)
<P>

This causes grief as my driver code for the d.a. card reassigns its IRQ to 11, but the card seems to ignore it and happily continues using IRQ10.
<P>

Can anyone point me to the place in the linux source code that deals with the allocation of IRQs for PCI cards? Better yet, is there some simple way to get around this problem? Oh for the days of good ol' ISA cards.
<P>

Thanks so much,
Carl
