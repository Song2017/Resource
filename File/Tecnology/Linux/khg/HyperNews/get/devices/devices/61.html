Ok, at the risk of sounding stupid, I'm going to ask the
following question:
<P>

In the "strategy" routine of a block device driver, is it 
possible to call the "block_read" and "block_write" functions, 
with the intent of using a dummy inode and file handle to
read and write data from OTHER devices?
<P>

The reason I ask is that I am toying with the concept of
writing a "virtual disk" device driver - and thus when
the virtual disk needs to read or write in its strategy
routine, it would need to use various other devices
to read and write from the underlying REAL devices.
<P>

Is this at all possible? If not, why not - and how
the hell would you approach this problem if not!!?   

<P>
