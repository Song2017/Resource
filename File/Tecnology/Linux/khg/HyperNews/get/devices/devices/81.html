<p>This is the first time that I ( and my friend) ever 
try to write a device driver.   Since we  have no experience with programming
some part of the kernel, we are quite puzzled as to where
to start and how to do the following task:
</p>
<br>
<p>    The thing that we are trying to do is this: 
There is a tape drive on some machine ( say B) in our network. And we want to be able to manipulate that device remotely from our machine ( say  A). and
we want it  to take place in the following way:
</p> 
<p>
When a program on machine A opens the device ( the local /dev/tape_device 
file on A) and does some reads, writes, ioctls on it ( and whatever can be done 
on a tape device) we want these calls to be redirected to the device on
machine B, and when the device on B  responds to these calls (to some ioctl
, read ,write, close ,open) we want these responds to be returned
to the call that was made from the program on machine A
</p>
<p>How would this be best done? The obvious thing we have in mind is to 
(if it is possible:) open a tcp socket from within our device driver and
connect to B ( where a daemon is working for this purpose ) and have 
that daemon to do the required read/write/open/close/ioctl and get back
replies from this socket- or again is it possible to do rpc calls from
within a device driver? if it is  does it make sense to write
remote versions of read/write/ioctl/open/close/etc? 
</p>
<p>
I will be getting Rubini's book on drivers in which - i hope-
i will find more info about tape drivers. but in the meanwhile is there
any place ( besides the kernel source) where i can get more info on
tapes? 
<p>
The machine we are working on is a Pentium200MMX - the kernel is 2.0.30
and the tape device we are tinkering with is ( the only thing i know about
it) connected via the floppy disk controller.
