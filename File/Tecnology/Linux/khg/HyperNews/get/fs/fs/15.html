I found a bit of old information about ACLs (similar to those in Solaris and HP_UX) by Artem Belevich and Peter Rival at 
<A HREF="http://www.dwc.edu/users/frival/acl/">http://www.dwc.edu/users/frival/acl/</A> .
<P>

Nothing seems to be updated on this and I have a strong desire to see this implemented in Linux (it would mean I can get rid of a Solaris machine which costs me a lot of $$$ for comparatively little bang.)
<P>

The code I did find, seems to be for 2.1.x although it references some members in the inode structure that don't seem to be there; I don't know what the ramifications are in 
modifying that structure. 
<P>

I am willing to work on this project, if labour is needed, however my kernel hacking skills are not as strong as I would like them to be. 
<P>

Any information on this is appreciated :)
