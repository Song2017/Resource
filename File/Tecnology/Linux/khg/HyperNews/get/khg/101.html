<PRE>Hi!

I'm considering of connecting to linux machines through
parallel ports for test purposes.

I'd like to get ecp/epp working and it seems that
plip drivers are for nibble mode only?

Has anyone done or know where to find application/driver
to connect to machines this way?

I know that there is driver iomega drive that can use
parallel port in ecp/epp mode. But does it fit in my
situation?

Also if I make such a program myself, is there some kind
of cable ready or do I have to make one myself?
And how to connect pins in that cable?
I think that data lines go one to one and ground pins of
course. And select in pin too? How about the others?
Do I just plan those myself or is there a some kind of
standard for that?

Hopefully someone has time to answer to my many questions,
because I haven't been able to find information about
those things.
