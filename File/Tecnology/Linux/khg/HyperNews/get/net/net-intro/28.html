I was looking through alloc_skb, and ran across this:
<P>


<PRE>  bptr=(unsigned char *)kmalloc(size,priority);
  skb=(struct sk_buff *)(bptr+size)-1;</PRE>
<P>


<PRE>  skb-&gt;count = 1;   /* only one reference to this */
  skb-&gt;data_skb = NULL; /* and we're our own data skb */</PRE>
<P>

There where some comments as well:
<P>


<PRE>  /*
   *  Now we play a little game with the caches. Linux kmalloc is
   *  a bit cache dumb, in fact its just about maximally non 
   *  optimal for typical kernel buffers. We actually run faster
   *  by doing the following. Which is to deliberately put the
   *  skb at the _end_ not the start of the memory block.
   */</PRE>
<P>

which don't really make much sense to me, but that's ok.
I'm confused by the pointer arithmatic.  In the second
line after you are given a pointer to a block of memory
you are incrementing it by it's size - 1 essentially 
now it poits to the last byte in the allocated memory,
right?
<P>

so then you do a "skb-&gt;count = 1;", which should break
everything since you are addressing memory outside of the
allocated block, right?  Obviously not since it works, but
I'm very confused.
<P>

I thought that skb-&gt;count would ADD an offset to the pointer skb, which now would be outside the kalloked area ?!?!?  Maybe I'm missing the obvious, or perhaps I don't quite understand all that is involved here.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but if
you tried this with plain old malloc you WOULD be in trouble, right??
<P>

Can somebody explain this to me, please.
<P>

Thanks,
Radu
