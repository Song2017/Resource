This is a nightly mirror of the Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide.

Point your web browser at file://`pwd`/HyperNews/get/khg.html
(where `pwd` is expanded as it would be in shell as the current
directory) to read the KHG off-line.  To post to the KHG, you
will need to be connected, but this should lower your connection
costs for reading.

This archive is created with the getwww program available from
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/www/mirroring/getwww-1.4.tar.gz
using the command line arguments:
getwww http://www.redhat.com:8080/HyperNews/get/khg.html \
  -S johnsonm embed frame outline show=all admin Response \
  -D HyperNews/SECURED HyperNews/thread.pl HyperNews/edit-subscribe.pl \
  -i

If you create a mirror of the KHG, I ask that you PLEASE update
your mirror at least nightly.  I don't want any out-of-date material
floating around.  Thanks!
