<a href="HyperNews/get/khg.html">This is a nightly mirror</a> of the
<a href="http://www.redhat.com:8080/HyperNews/get/khg.html">Linux
Kernel Hackers' Guide</a>.
To post to the KHG, you will need to be connected, but this should
lower your connection costs.

<p>This archive is created with the

<p>If you create a mirror of the KHG, I ask that you <b>please</b> update
your mirror at least nightly.  I don't want any out-of-date material
floating around.  Thanks!
