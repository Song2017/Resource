        Linux kernel release 1.0

These are the release notes for linux version 1.0.  Read them carefully,
as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to install the
kernel, and what to do if something goes wrong.

WHAT IS LINUX?

  Linux is a Unix clone for 386/486-based PCs written from scratch by
  Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers
  across the Net.  It aims towards POSIX compliance.

  It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged
  Unix, including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries,
  demand loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory
  management and TCP/IP networking.

  It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
  accompanying COPYING file for more details.
