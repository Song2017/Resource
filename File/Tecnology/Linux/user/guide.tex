% introduction (who should read this book, etc.)
\include{intro}

% what's unix?
% history of unix and other non-needed things
\include{unixinfo}

% introduction to Linux---starting, stopping, messages
% this is how PCs boot up, what they load, what the kernel does, and
% some of the messages the kernel prints out while running---the
% messages perhaps should be moved to ``errors.tex''
\include{starting}

% introduction to the shell: commands, storing information
\include{shell}

% this teaches about the X Window System, for those people who
% encountered it when they logged on
\include{x11}

% more advance shell stuff: piping, redirection, filters, more
% commands
\include{shell2}

% talks about some of the simplier commands, with discussions of
% common command-line options and uses
\include{commands}

% editing files with Emacs
\include{emacs}

% variables of sorts---configuration: .profile, .bashrc, .bash_logout
% (or whatever bash calls a script to be run at logout). Shell
% variables, environment variables, aliases
\include{config}

% network programs
\include{network}

% programs to play with
% this can be a variety of things. Currently, it contains some
% oversized commands that have non-standard interfaces. I'd like to
% cover any of the bigger commands that have their own documentation
% briefly. We might want to move these things somewhere else
