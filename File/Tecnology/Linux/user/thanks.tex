\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

The author would like to thank the following people for their
invaluable help either with \linux\ itself, or in writing \uguide:

\begin{description}
\item [Linus Torvalds] \index{Torvalds, Linus} for providing something
to write this manual about.

\item [Karl Fogel] \index{Fogel, Karl} has given me much help with
  writing my \linux\ documentation and wrote most of
  Chapter~\ref{emacs-chapter} and Chapter~\ref{configuration-chapter}.
  I cannot give him enough credit.

\item [Maurizio Codogno] \index{Codogno, Maurizio} wrote much of
  Chapter~\ref{funny-chapter}.

\item [David Channon] \index{Channon, David} wrote the appendix on
  {\tt vi}. (Appendix~\ref{vi-chapter})

\item [Yggdrasil Computing, Inc.] for their generous (and voluntary) support
  of this manual.
  
\item [Red Hat Software] for their (more recent and still voluntary!)
  support.

\item [The {\tt fortune} program] for supplying me with many of the
  wonderful quotes that start each chapter.  They cheer me up, if no
  one else.
